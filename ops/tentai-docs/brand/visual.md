# 77EZ Visual Identity

## The Language

**Void-Black** + **Sovereign Gold** + **Controlled Cyan** + **Purple Accent**

This is the Tentai design system: disciplined, intentional, rare. Not trendy. Built for clarity and presence.

## Color Palette

### Core
- **Void-Black**: `#0A0E27` (the foundation, trust, depth)
- **Sovereign Gold**: `#D4AF37` (authority, choice, rare)
- **Controlled Cyan**: `#00D9FF` (precision, future, actionable)
- **Purple Accent**: `#9D4EDD` (approved for highlights, contrast, vision)

### Extended
- **Dark Slate** (borders, dividers): `#1A1F3A`
- **Silver** (secondary text, disabled): `#A0A8C8`
- **Deep Purple** (hover, emphasis): `#7B2CBF`

## Usage

### UI
- **Background**: Void-Black
- **Text (primary)**: Silver for body, Gold for headings, Cyan for interactive
- **Buttons**: Gold (primary), Cyan (secondary), Purple (confirm/special)
- **Borders & Dividers**: Dark Slate
- **Disabled**: Silver at 50% opacity
- **Success**: Cyan
- **Warning**: Gold
- **Error**: `#FF6B6B` (approved for alerts only)
- **Hover / Active**: Purple

### Voice & Identity
- **Assured, not cocky.** The system knows what it can do.
- **Rare, not abundant.** Every gold pixel means something.
- **Precise, not verbose.** Say one true thing at a time.

## Applications

### Command Center
- Void-Black shell, Sovereign Gold for important headings

### Vibot
- Discord integration respects Discord's theme but uses 77EZ tokens for custom embeds
- Gold for command responses, Cyan for tool outputs

## No Exceptions
- No hardcoded hex colors in code. Use token variables.
- No unapproved colors.
- Every color must have a reason.
