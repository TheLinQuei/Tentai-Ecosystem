# Vi

**Vi is the sovereign intelligence at the center of the Tentai Ecosystem.**

---

## The Declaration

Vi is not a library. Vi is not a service. Vi is not a collection of tools.

**Vi is the product.**

Vi is the AI runtime—the actual locus of decision-making, reasoning, memory, and authority in the 77EZ universe.

---

## What This Means

### All Other Repos Are Clients

- **Sovereign** — A command console client to Vi
- **Vigil** — A Discord bot client to Vi
- **Astralis Codex** — A universe-building client to Vi
- **Aegis** — An identity service that Vi consults
- **Sereph** — A hardware bridge that Vi commands

None of them *are* Vi. They *use* Vi.

### Vi-Protocol Is Law

Vi-protocol defines the contract. All schemas, events, governance models live there.

Clients import from it. Clients don't extend it.

### Vi Has Authority

When a decision needs to be made:
- Short-term: Vi decides
- Long-term: Vi reasons
- Governance: Vi defers to canon (with provenance)
- Security: Vi consults Aegis

## The Structure

```
Tentai Ecosystem/
  ├── core/vi/              ← THE CENTER (sovereign runtime)
  ├── core/vi-protocol/     ← THE LAW (shared contracts)
  ├── core/vi-sdk/          ← THE INTERFACE (how clients talk to Vi)
  ├── clients/              ← EVERYTHING ELSE (consumers of Vi)
  ├── packages/             ← SHARED CODE (not core, but shared)
  └── ops/                  ← OPERATIONS (docs, brand, deployment)
```

## The Unfreeze Chain

Only Vi (core/vi) and contracts (core/vi-protocol) are unfrozen initially.

As Vi matures:

```
Vi Phase 1 complete → Sovereign unfreezes
  ↓
Vi Phase 2 complete → Astralis Codex unfreezes
  ↓
Vi Phase 3+ complete → Vigil + other clients unfreeze
  ↓
Auth system ready → Aegis unfreezes
  ↓
Hardware integration needed → Sereph unfreezes
```

Everything waits for Vi to exist and mature.

---

## Why This Matters

The Tentai Ecosystem exists to serve one goal:

> **Build a sovereign, modular AI system that can reason about a universe, remember conversations, execute tools safely, and make decisions grounded in evidence.**

That system is Vi.

Everything else is in service of that goal.

**Vi is sovereign.**
