# ARCHIVE - Old Documentation

**These files are obsolete.** Do not use them as reference.

All current information is in:
- [../core/vi/MASTER-PLAN-77EZ.md](../core/vi/MASTER-PLAN-77EZ.md) — The roadmap
- [../docs/GETTING-STARTED.md](../docs/GETTING-STARTED.md) — Quick start + team assignments
- [../docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md](../docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md) — Navigation hub
- [../docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md](../docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md) — Live tracker

## Why archived?

These were historical investigation reports, competing roadmaps, audit receipts, and progress summaries from earlier phases. They've been consolidated into the 4 canonical documents above.

## For reference only

If you need historical context on a decision or investigation, these files provide that. But for current work, use the 4 canonical docs above.

**Last cleanup: January 10, 2026**
