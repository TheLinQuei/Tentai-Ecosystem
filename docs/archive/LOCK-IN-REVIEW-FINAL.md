# Milestone 1 Lock-In: Complete

**Status: LOCKED IN** ✅

---

## Answers to Wednesday's Questions

### Q1: Where is the canonical verification artifact?

**Answer:** `core/vi/docs/verification/2025-12-22_210827-m1-verification.log`

This is an actual file (not terminal history) with full transcript, timestamped, committed to repo.

### Q2: Do you agree "logs saved to file or it didn't happen"?

**Answer:** YES. Absolute rule now (Section 13 updated).

- Terminal history = not proof
- Report must link to `.log` file path
- Log must exist in repo or be reproducibly generated
- If log missing, report is rejected immediately

### Q3: Why not make a persistent verification script?

**Answer:** DONE. Created `core/vi/scripts/verify-m1.ps1`

What it does:
```powershell
clean (remove node_modules dist package-lock.json)
npm install
npm run type-check
npm run build
start server (background)
curl http://localhost:3000/v1/health
stop server
cli --version
cli --help
write all output to docs/verification/<timestamp>-m1-verification.log
```

Single invocation: `pwsh scripts/verify-m1.ps1`  
Output: Full timestamped log with all commands and responses

### Q4: Dependencies — lock now or later?

**Answer:** LATER.

Current state:
- Fastify `^4.20.0` (allows 4.x, locks major)
- Pino `^8.18.0`
- Zod `^3.22.0`
- `package-lock.json` locks exact versions after first install

Assessment: Adequate for Phase 1. If Phase 2+ requires iron-clad reproducibility, pin exact versions then.

### Q5: Section 13 enforcement — checklist or CI?

**Answer:** BOTH.

Immediate (now):
- PR checklist: "Report must reference verification log file"
- Manual: Humans reject reports without logs

Future (Phase 2+):
- CI grep check: Fails if report contains forbidden language or lacks log reference

### Q6: Are 5 promises + 5 non-promises in docs?

**Answer:** YES. Both sections now in [README.md](core/vi/README.md):

**Milestone 1 Public API Guarantees:**
1. Server is reachable (port 3000)
2. Health endpoint exists (GET /v1/health)
3. CLI is callable (version, help, chat, ask, debug)
4. Logging is structured (Pino to disk)
5. Config is externalized (env vars with defaults)

**Milestone 1 Explicit Non-Promises:**
1. No multi-modal handling
2. No LLM integration
3. No database persistence
4. No authentication
5. No request validation

## What Changed Since Previous Sync

1. ✅ Created `scripts/verify-m1.ps1` — single-run verification script
2. ✅ Ran script → generated `docs/verification/2025-12-22_210827-m1-verification.log`
3. ✅ Updated completion report → links to log file + script
4. ✅ Updated Section 13 → logs are mandatory, non-negotiable
5. ✅ Updated README → added promises + non-promises verbatim
6. ✅ Artifact chain complete → report → log → script → source code

## The Chain (Audit Trail)

```
MILESTONE-1-COMPLETION.md
  ↓ references
docs/verification/2025-12-22_210827-m1-verification.log (actual file with transcript)
  ↓ generated by
scripts/verify-m1.ps1
  ↓ tests
src/config/config.ts (port 3000)
src/runtime/server.ts (/v1/health)
```

**Guarantee:** If any link breaks, report is invalid. Humans cannot accidentally reinvent Express.

## Ready for Milestone 2

✅ Evidence locked (config + server files)  
✅ Verification script created + executed  
✅ Log file committed to repo  
✅ Completion report updated  
✅ Section 13 enforcement enabled  
✅ Public API promises documented  
✅ Non-promises documented  

**Milestone 1 is truth. Ready to build Milestone 2 against it.**
