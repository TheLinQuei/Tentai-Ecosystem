  "summary": "Tenkai are an elevated branch of humanity whose evolution diverged along the path of cognition, resonance, and willpower, not divinity. Distinguished by their heterochromatic eyes and heightened mental acuity, the Tenkai embody potential—not perfection.\n\nThey are born, not forged. Mortal, not divine.\nWhat sets them apart is their mind:\ntheir ability to interpret resonant languages, track fate-patterns, and imprint memory structures with impossible precision.\n\nTenkai shape history not through power, but through understanding.",
