## Summary

Tenkai are an elevated branch of humanity whose evolution diverged along the path of cognition, resonance, and willpower, not divinity. Distinguished by their heterochromatic eyes and heightened mental acuity, the Tenkai embody potential—not perfection.

They are born, not forged. Mortal, not divine.
What sets them apart is their mind:
their ability to interpret resonant languages, track fate-patterns, and imprint memory structures with impossible precision.

Tenkai shape history not through power, but through understanding.

**Core Traits:** Enhanced cognition, Resonance perception (fate-lines, soul-patterns, metaphysical structures), Accelerated learning, High emotional discipline, Pattern memory (eidetic + intuitive extrapolation)

## Subtypes

House of Insight (Seers, Pattern-Readers), House of Echoes (Memory-Weavers), House of Resolve (Discipline, Mental Fortitude), House of Tongues (Linguistic Resonance)
